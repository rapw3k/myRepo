A Public Service is a mandatory or discretionary set of activities performed, or able to be performed, by or on behalf of a public organisation, publicly funded and arise from public policy. Services may be for the benefit of an individual, a business, or other public authority, or groups of any of these. A service exists whether it is used or not, and the term 'benefit' may apply in the sense of enabling the fulfilment of an obligation. As defined in the revised version of the European Interoperability Framework, a European public service comprises any service provided by public administrations in Europe, or by other organisations on their behalf, to businesses, citizens or others public administrations."
